This git hub is for testing many versions of ruby, which is installing rubies automatically.

Now, I am living in Korea, so ruby source mirror is for only in South Korea.

Soon, when I have time I will add more code for other mirrors.

============================================================================================

You can install many ruby version with .xz source files.

Just execute setup. For example "./setup".
You need sudo privilegement.
